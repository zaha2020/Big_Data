# Working with NoSQL Databases like MongoDB, Neo4j, Cassandra, and Elasticsearch for data analytics

## Decription:

In this project, we've worked with different NoSQL databases like MongoDB, Neo4j, Cassandra, and Elasticsearch for asked queries and data analysis.

## MongoDB
Queries for a crawled tweet from [Sahamyab site](https://www.sahamyab.com/) which are smart investment networks in Iran.

## Neo4j
After creating Nodes for each dataset of a Lord of the Rings film, we've written queries in `Cypher` to extract relevant data from created graphs for each query.

## Cassandra
Queries for Free Music Archive (FMA). As we don't have joins in Cassandra, we've created a special table for each requested query and after loading the table's data, we applied each requested query.

## Elasticsearch
Queries for crawled tweets from the Sahamyab site which are Smart investment network in Iran. Then a management dashboard was designed with Kibana.
